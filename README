# Object-stable unsupervised dual contrastive learning image-to-image translation with query-selected attention and convolutional block attention module

we proposed a dual-learning framework with QS-Attn and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) called object-stable dual contrastive learning generative adversarial network (OS-DCLGAN). In this paper, we utilize a CBAM, which learns what and where to emphasize or suppress, thereby refining intermediate features effectively. This CBAM was integrated before the QS-Attn module to capture significant domain information for I2I translation tasks. The proposed framework outperformed recently introduced approaches in various I2I translation tasks, showing its effectiveness and versatility.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 16.04
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN
- Python 3 Please use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.

## Training
- Download the horse2zebra dataset
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_cut_dataset.sh horse2zebra
```

- Train the OSUDL model:

```bash
python train.py \
--dataroot=datasets/horse2zebra \
--name=horse2zebra_OSUDL \
```


- You can use visdom to view the training loss:
Run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097.

## Inference

- Test the model:
```bash
python test.py \
--dataroot=datasets/horse2zebra \
--name=horse2zebra_OSUDL \
```
### Apply a pre-trained DCL model and evaluate
We provide our pre-trained DCLGAN models for:

Cat <-> Dog , Horse <-> Zebra , CityScapes model

You can test using the parameters in the Pre_train folder.
